<h1>SSA &nbsp; COMMAND IMPROVE BIOLOGY &nbsp; INTEGRITY OF SAND &nbsp; SOIL BLENDS</h1>

<p>Inclusion of SSA (Soil Symphony Amendment) into sand blends for top-dressing provides both organic matter and energy stocks that feed microbes. Included in the SSA formula are; specific meals, diatomaceous earth, ground crab meal and nutrients designed to stimulate the growth and maintenance of bacteria that elevate a soils suppressive nature to reduce both disease and pest pressure. Typical SSA inclusion rates per 22-ton load, based on application of 22 ton/acre topdressing rate are from 200 – 300 lb of SSA. The inclusion rate can be varied depending on specific needs. Specific microbial species and elicitors are available to light the biological fire.

<p>Inclusion of Command (designed compost material filtered for structure and utility) will provide aeration improvement allowing gas to escape and air (oxygen) to penetrate soil. The Command material is teeming with beneficial fungal and bacterial organisms. Fungus utilize the fiber as fuel stocks to expand mycelial growth. Sugars and smaller organic materials provide fuel for bacteria. The typical Command rates of inclusion in sand top-dress blends would be at a 10 – 20% final mixture by weight. More or less inclusion rates are available based on the intended purpose and usage rates. Command will improve and enhance the biology and physical characteristics of a sand blend compared with other organic materials commonly used.

<p>Combinations of SSA and Command will serve functions to feed beneficial bacteria and fungi and provide a better environment for their sustainability and activity. Soils suppressive nature to both pets and pathogen pressure is due to the presence of beneficial organisms living in the soil. These organisms are enhanced when proper fuel sources and other elicitors are combined to enhance both physical and chemical properties needed to balanced and sustain a biologically diverse soil system. SSA and Command together help build suppressive soils that have better biological, physical and chemical properties.
