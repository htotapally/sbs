	<p>Terra Feed Products
	
	<p>ACS – Agricultural Carbon Source is a filtered molasses material containing high levels of sugars and other food stocks for microbes, “Fuel for the soil”.
	
	<p>Sulfur-CARB – A source of elemental sulfur to facilitate pH reduction of the soil environment and containing energy to fuel the oxidation of sulfur for expedited and safe reaction in the root zone.
	
	<p>Turf-TAC – An adjuvant containing a sugar polymer material used with foliar application of nutrients and other chemicals to stick them to leaf surfaces. The polymer in Turf-TAC is also a feed stock (elicitor) for specific bacteria that fight crop disease, and can be used in soil application strategies.
	
	<p>SBS(A) – Soil Biological Symphony (A) is a unique mixture of bacteria that suppress diseases and many crop pests.
	
	<p>SBS(B) – Soil Biological Symphony (B) is a blend of fungal organisms that suppress disease organisms and many soil pests.
	
	<p>SSA – Soil Symphony Amendment is a dry (pelletized or fine crumble) high energy feed stock that supplies extended fuel, energy and other materials for soil microbes.
