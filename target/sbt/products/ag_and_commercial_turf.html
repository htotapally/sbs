	<p>Terra Feed Products
	
	<p>ACS – Agricultural Carbon Source is a filtered molasses material containing high levels of sugars and other food stocks for microbes, “Fuel for the soil”.
	
	<p>Sulfur-CARB – A source of elemental sulfur to facilitate pH reduction of the soil environment and containing energy to fuel the oxidation of sulfur for expedited and safe reaction in the root zone. Nutra-TAC – An adjuvant containing a sugar polymer material used with foliar application of nutrients and other chemicals to stick them to leaf surfaces. The polymer in Nutra-TAC is also a feed stock (elicitor) for specific bacteria that fight crop disease, and can be used in soil application strategies.
	
	<p>SBS(A) – Soil Biological Symphony (A) is a unique mixture of bacteria that suppress diseases and many crop pests.
	
	<p>SBS(B) – Soil Biological Symphony (B) is a blend of fungal organisms that suppress disease organisms and many soil pests.
	
	<p>SSA – Soil Symphony Amendment is a dry (pelletized or fine crumble) high energy feed stock that supplies extended fuel, energy and other materials for soil microbes.
