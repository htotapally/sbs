<h1>TURF-TAC</h1>

<p>Turf-TAC is a custom formulated solution containing dissolved chitin (chitosan) intended for use as a sticking agent in foliar sprayâ€™s and also as an elicitor of bacteria that consume chitin. The chitosan polymer forms a thin coating over the surface of leaves or other vegetative plant materials. When using Turf-TAC other adjuvants designed to hold material onto leaves are not needed.

<p>Turf-TAC contains chitosan, the soluble form of chitin. Chitin is the material that crustaceans and insect skeletons are constructed. Chitin and chitosan have been used for years to elicit defense responses from plants. When sprayed onto leaves it ultimately washes off into the soil where its second beneficial property is revealed. Bacteria in the soil that consume chitin are stimulated by the soluble fraction of chitin called chitosan in Turf-TAC. Chitin is a polymer containing nitrogen and sugar (glucose). It serves as a fuel/food source for specific organisms with enzymatic ability to dissolve the material. These same organisms will attack soil pests and pathogens that contain chitin in their body.

<p>Turf-TAC because of the chitosan, is an elicitor of plant protective defense systems and also serves as a direct food source for Chitinolytic organisms that consume chitin. When Turf-TAC is incorporated into a program with regular usage, the stimulation of Chitinolytic bacteria helps to build suppressive soils and ultimately fight disease and reduce pest pressure.

	<li>Soil Biological Symphony (SBS-A) is a concentrated source of bacteria including Chitinolytic species when used with Turf-TAC, a defense response is elicited against pests and pathogens. The microbes in SBS-A include many bacteria species including Chitinolytic species, that use Turf-TAC as a primary food source
